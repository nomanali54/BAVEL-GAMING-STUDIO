            <div class="section">
                <h2>Advertising and Analytics:</h2>
                <p>Advertising: When we offer our Games as free-to-play, we still require the game to generate income to help fund development costs and efforts to make the best game possible. Advertising is one way we can help cover our costs, and in order to implement relevant advertising a certain amount of information may be collected by each third-party ad network that operates within our Games. That information may be considered personally identifiable, or it could be considered personally identifiable in certain circumstances. This information is only ever used for our legitimate business interests and will never be sold or shared by us.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the data is provided to us by third parties. While we use all reasonable commercial endeavors to ensure that they adhere to any applicable laws, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with their data policies.</p>
                <p>A list of each ad network we use and information about what data they collect is contained at the conclusion of this policy. Please read those privacy policies carefully before using our Games.</p>
                <p>Analytics: Information collected about our Game usage and about your device and location, allows us to better integrate updates, find potential device specific problems and bugs, explore localisation opportunities and make better Games that are tailored to our user’s needs.</p>

                <h2>How Do we Use Data We Collect</h2>
                <p>Data collected for Advertising</p>
                <p>Because many Not Doppler Games are free-to-play, we periodically display in-game advertising by third parties to generate revenue. In order to display relevant advertising (also known as ‘interest based advertising’) and measure performance of advertising campaigns we have implemented several ad-networks within the game which may collect and transfer non-sensitive device information such as:</p>
                <p>The advertisement you have viewed and if you have engaged with it;</p>
                <p>Device make and manufacturer;</p>
                <p>Operating System;</p>
                <p>Generic geographic location, such as the city you are located in;</p>
                <p>Carrier;</p>
                <p>Language settings;</p>
                <p>IP Address;</p>
                <p>Android Advertising identifier or Apple Identifier for Advertisers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Data collected for Analytics</h2>
                <p>We have implemented Analytics tools to help us understand how our Games are being used in order to help us improve our Games and plan for future game releases. For example we use Flurry Analytics and Google Analytics to keep track of how many players are engaging with our Games, player progress, any in-app purchases, as well as device type, operating system, language settings, play session lengths and broad geographic information like your country and city.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
